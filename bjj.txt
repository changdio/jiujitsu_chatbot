Brazilian jiu-jitsu
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ); /dʒuːˈdʒɪtsuː/; Portuguese: [ˈʒiw ˈʒit(i)su],
[ˈʒu ˈʒit(i)su], [dʒiˈu dʒit(i)ˈsu], jiu-jitsu brasileiro) Is a self-defence
martial art and combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting
(newaza) and submission holds. It focuses on the skill of taking an
opponent to the ground, controlling one's opponent, gaining a
dominant position and using a number of techniques to force them
into submission via joint locks or chokeholds.
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was first developed in the 1920 by Brazilian
brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., George and Hélio Gracie after
Carlos Gracie was taught traditional Kodokan Judo by a travelling
Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda. Later going onto develop their own
self-defense system named Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.
BJJ eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the
innovations, practices and adaptation of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and Judo,
becoming an essential martial art for MMA, with Governing bodies
such as the IBJJF work worldwide, setting the competition rulesets
and standards
BJJ revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can
successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, heavier
opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to
the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat
them. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling and in self-defence
situations. Sparring, commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ
community, and live drilling plays a major role in training and the
practitioner's development. BJJ can also be used as a method of
promoting physical fitness, building character, and as a way of
life.[4][5]

Mitsuyo Maeda one of five Kodokan's top groundwork experts trained by judo's founder Kano Jigoro was
sent overseas to demonstrate and spread his art to the world. He left Japan in 1904 and visited a number of
countries[6] giving "jiu-do" demonstrations and accepting challenges from wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters,
and various other martial artists, and arrived in Brazil on 14 November 1914.[7] Maeda had trained first in
sumo as a teenager, and after the interest generated by stories about the success of Kodokan judo at
competitions with other jujutsu schools of the time, he became a student of Kano.[6]
Maeda & Gracie
History
Origins
Gastão Gracie was a business partner of the American Circus in Belém. In 1916, Italian Argentine circus
Queirolo Brothers staged shows there and presented Maeda.[8][9]
In 1917 Carlos Gracie (eldest son of Gastão Gracie)[10] watched a ‘Kano Jiu-Jitsu’ demonstration by Maeda at
the Da Paz Theatre and decided he wanted to learn. Maeda accepted Carlos as a student and Carlos was taught
for a few years, (believed to be 5-6 year) eventually passing his knowledge on to his brothers. Gracie's account
of the events is that his younger sibling Hélio Gracie gradually developed Gracie jiu-jitsu as a softer, pragmatic
adaptation that focused more on the ground fighting and leverage aspect of Jiu-Jitsu/Judo (ne-waza) rather than
the throws, as he was unable to perform many Judo throws, due to his size, that required direct opposition to
an opponent's strength.[11][12]
Although the Gracie family is typically recognized as the main family to first promote Brazilian jiu-jitsu as it is
known today, there was also another prominent lineage derived from Maeda via another Brazilian disciple,
Luiz França.[13] This lineage had been represented particularly by Oswaldo Fadda. Fadda and his students
were famous for the influential use of footlocks,[14] and the lineage still survives through Fadda's links in
teams such as Nova União and Grappling Fight Team (GF Team).[15]
The name "jiu-jitsu" derives from an older romanization of its original spelling in the West; the modern
Hepburn romanization of 柔術 is "jūjutsu".
When Maeda left Japan, judo was still often referred to as "Kano jiu-jitsu",[16] or, even more generically,
simply as jiu-jitsu.[17][18] Higashi, the co-author of Kano Jiu-Jitsu[16] wrote in the foreword:
Some confusion has arisen over the employment of the term 'jiudo'. To make the matter clear I
will state that jiudo is the term selected by Professor Kano as describing his system more
accurately than jiu-jitsu does. Professor Kano is one of the leading educators of Japan, and it is
natural that he should cast about for the technical word that would most accurately describe his
system. But the Japanese people generally still cling to the more popular nomenclature and call it
jiu-jitsu.[16]
Outside Japan, however, this distinction was noted even less. Thus, when Maeda and Satake arrived in Brazil
in 1914, every newspaper announced their art as being "jiu-jitsu", despite both men being Kodokan judoka.
It was not until 1925 that the Japanese government itself officially mandated that the correct name for the
martial art taught in the Japanese public schools should be "judo" rather than "jujutsu".[19] In Brazil, the art is
still called "jiu-jitsu". When the Gracies went to the United States and spread jiu-jitsu, they used the terms
"Gracie jiu-jitsu" and non-Gracies using the term ”Brazilian jiu-jitsu” to differentiate from the already present
styles using similar-sounding names. In a 1994 interview with Yoshinori Nishi, Hélio Gracie said that he didn't
even know the word of Judo itself until the sport came in the 1950s to Brazil, because he heard that Mitsuyo
Maeda called his style "jiu-jitsu".
The art is sometimes referred to as Gracie jiu-jitsu (GJJ), a name trademarked by Rorion Gracie, but after a
legal dispute with his cousin Carley Gracie, his trademark to the name was voided.[20] Other members of the
Gracie family often call their style by personalized names, such as Ceaser Gracie Jiu-Jitsu or Renzo Gracie Jiu-
Jitsu, and similarly, the Machado family call their style Machado Jiu-Jitsu (MJJ). While each style and its
instructors have their own unique aspects, they are all basic variations of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. There are currently
Name
four major BJJ branches in Brazil: Gracie Humaita, Gracie Barra, Carlson Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and Alliance Jiu
Jitsu. Each branch traces its roots back to Mitsuyo Maeda via Donato Pires Dos Reis,[21] and then through the
Gracie family or Oswaldo Fadda.
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu share some techniques with the original Kodokan Judo, especially certain styles practiced
before Judo became part of the Olympics such as Kosen Judo,[22][23] and still practiced to a lesser extent,[24]
as well as with the earlier ryu school of Jujutsu.[25] It has been argued that the Brazilians didn't actually created
any fundamental innovations within the art.[26] Some practitioners have suggested that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
should just be called "Jiu-Jitsu".[27]
Certain changes were made to the rules of sport judo after judo was introduced to Brazil. Some of these rule
changes sought to enhance it as a spectator sport, and others aimed to improve safety. Several of these rule
changes de-emphasized the groundwork aspects of judo, and others have reduced the range of joint locks
application. Brazilian jiu-jitsu did not follow these changes to judo rules, and this divergence gave BJJ a
distinct identity as a ground focused grappling art, this difference was later consolidated with the creation of a
new set of rules that guide BJJ practice today.[28]
Even though BJJ permits the same techniques as judo when taking the combat to the ground they are not
scored in the same way. In Judo throwing techniques are scored higher and can give a direct victory if
executed correctly, the emphasis of the fight is to sweep or thrown the opponent to the ground to win. In BJJ
ground fighting positions such as the rear mount receive higher scores, and the focus of the fight is to establish
a dominant position against the adversary on the ground and submit him using chokeholds or jointlocks.
BJJ also allows heelhooks and knee-reaping which are prohibited in Judo, and any takedowns used in
wrestling, sambo, or other grappling arts, including direct attempts to take down by touching the legs or
dragging the opponent to the ground.[29] Spinal locks and cervical locks are not allowed in gi jiu-jitsu,[28]
amateur MMA,[30] multiple forms of no-gi jiu-jitsu,[28] Judo,[31] and other martial arts,[32] due to potential to
cause serious bodily injury. BJJ also has become more "sports-oriented" in recent years, prohibiting techniques
such as slams.[33] Another divergence of BJJ from Judo and Jujutsu is that it allows no-gi practice and
competition, having its own subset of rules; use of holds and takedowns from wrestling and other grappling
styles is common in no-gi BJJ, and strikes are also used when the competition rules permits.
In 1972, Carley Gracie moved to the United States to teach jiu-jitsu, and in 1978 was followed by Rorion
Gracie, who co-founded the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in 1993.[34][35] Jiu-jitsu came to
international prominence in martial arts circles when Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert Royce Gracie won the first,
second and fourth Ultimate Fighting Championships, which at the time were single elimination martial arts
tournaments. Royce fought against several larger opponents proficient in other fighting styles, including
boxing, shoot-fighting, muay thai, karate, wrestling, and taekwondo. BJJ has since become an elementary
aspect of MMA, revealing the importance of ground fighting in a fight. Sport BJJ tournaments continue to
grow in popularity and have given rise to no-gi submission grappling tournaments, such as the ADCC
Submission Wrestling World Championship and NAGA, the North American Grappling Association. Sport
BJJ has also become a popular method of fitness around the world in recent years.[36][37]

Brazilian jiu-jitsu focuses on getting an opponent to the ground in order to neutralize possible strength or size
advantages through ground fighting techniques and submission holds involving joint-locks and chokeholds.
On the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced through proper grappling techniques.
BJJ employs a wide range of takedown techniques to bring an opponent to the ground such as "pulling
guard", which is not used in other combat sports such as Judo or Wrestling. Once the opponent is on the
ground, a number of manoeuvres (and counter-manoeuvres) are available to manipulate the opponent into a
suitable position for the application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the ground is
one of the hallmarks of BJJ, which includes effective use of the guard position to defend oneself from bottom
(using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility of dominant position or an
opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the guard to dominate from top position with side control, mount,
and back mount positions. This system of manoeuvring and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic or
physical chess when executed by two experienced practitioners.[38] A submission hold in BJJ is often
assimilated to the equivalent of "checkmate", where the opponent is left with no other option but to tap, be
injured, or choked.
Renzo Gracie wrote in his book Mastering JUJITSU:
"The classical jujutsu of old Japan appeared to have no common strategy to guide a combatant
over the course of a fight. Indeed, this was one of Kano's most fundamental and perceptive
criticisms of the classical program." Maeda not only taught the art of judo to Carlos Gracie, but
also taught a particular philosophy about the nature of combat developed by Kano, and further
refined by Maeda based on his worldwide travels competing against fighters skilled in a wide
variety of martial arts.[39]
The book details Maeda's theory as arguing that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases,
such as the striking phase, the grappling phase, the ground phase, etc. Thus, it was a smart fighter's task to
keep the fight located in the phase of combat best suited to his own strengths. Renzo Gracie stated that this
was a fundamental influence of the Gracie approach to combat. These strategies were further developed over
time by the Gracies and others, and became prominent in contemporary MMA.
Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu is mainly differentiated from other martial arts by
its greater emphasis on ground fighting. BJJ places less emphasis on
standing techniques, such as striking and throws, although takedowns
score points and the rules allows for a diverse range of techniques
such as single, double leg takedowns, or foot sweeps. Some BJJ
practitioners also cross train with wrestling, judo, and sambo.
As BJJ focuses on submissions, sparring and live drilling become the
most essential part of the training regime, this type of training allows
practitioners to practice at full speed and with full strength, resembling the effort made in a competition.
Training methods include drills in which techniques are practiced against a non-resisting and resisting partners;
isolation sparring (commonly referred to as positional drilling) where only a certain technique or sets of
techniques are used; and full sparring where each practitioner tries to submit their opponent through technique.
Physical conditioning is also an important aspect of training.

Training methods

control
The Gracie family lineage descended from Helio Gracie focuses on
practical applications of BJJ that apply primarily to self-defence.[40]
They will often run development drills in which a person is
surrounded by a circle of other students who will attempt to attack the
defending student, who in turn must defend themselves using
techniques. The student will often be unable to see the aggressor to
simulate an attack that they weren't expecting.
Once on the ground, the BJJ practitioner strives to take a dominant or
controlling position from where to apply submissions. These positions
provide different submission or transition options.
In side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from
the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with
weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further
controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from
the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of
submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as
the side mount. Additionally, the typical side mount increases
opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant
positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top
fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defence. There are
many variants of the side control position, including kesa gatame,
standard side control, reverse side control, and other positions.[41]
The knee on belly position is a modified side pin that is distinctly separated from the side control position. The
knee on belly position is characterized primarily by the control of the opponent with one leg out for base and
balance and the other leg positioned across the opponent's torso pinning them to the ground. This form of pin
is a mobile pin rather than a static pin and is considered a more dominant position in many grappling formats.
The knee on belly position is worth additional points because it provides a greater striking platform than
traditional side control and is closer to achieving the more ideal mounted position.[42]
In the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's front torso or chest, controlling
the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his
knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission
attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.

When taking the back mount
position (often known in
Brazilian jiu-jitsu as the back
grab or attacking the back),
the practitioner attaches to the
back of the opponent by
wrapping his legs around and
hooking the opponent's
thighs with their heel,[28] or
locking in a body triangle by
crossing one shin across the
waist like a belt then placing
the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body
is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to
apply chokeholds, as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent's potential size or strength
advantage.
The North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is
lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner's arms. As with most top
controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the
ground, generating what is referred to as dead weight. There are several submissions and transitions that are
possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South kimura, and
others.[43]
When in the "Guard" position, the practitioner is on their back
controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes
and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements
of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of
counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and
sweeps.
The three most common types of guards include the Closed Guard,
Half Guard, and Open Guard.
In closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the
opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent.
The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as
jointlocks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom
grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.
There are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard,
De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Rubber guard, Spider Guard, Octopus Guard, Lapel Guard, Worm Guard
(made popular by Keenan Cornelius) and others. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs
up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly
wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability to counter the opponent with the
shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.

In the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, preventing the top
opponent from passing side control or full mount positions. There is also a variant of half guard called "50/50
guard", which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg
of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct
advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.
Another variation of the half guard position is the "deep half guard", which involves the bottom grappler
positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler's thigh. This gives the individual
on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This
position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, Jeff Glover.[44]
The majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: joint locks and chokes. Joint locks
typically involve isolating an opponent's limb and creating a lever with the body position, which will force the
joint to move past its normal range of motion.[45] Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if
the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by tapping. A choke hold can disrupt the blood supply
to the brain and cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not tap when required.
See also Compression lock
A less common type of submission hold is a compression lock, where the muscle of an opponent is
compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent.
These types of locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing muscle tissue. This
type of lock also often hyper-extends the joint in the opposite direction, pulling it apart. Some compression
locks include the Achilles lock, Biceps slicer, and Leg slicer (or Calf slicer).
While many joint locks are permitted in BJJ, most competitions ban or restrict
some or all joint locks that involve the knees, ankles, and spine. The reason
for this is that the angles of manipulation required to cause pain are nearly the
same as those that would cause serious injury. Joint locks that require a
twisting motion of the knee (such as heel hooks or knee bars) are usually
banned in competitions because successfully completing the move can
frequently result in permanent damage, often requiring surgery. Similarly, joint
manipulations of the spine are typically barred due to the inherent danger of
crushing or misaligning cervical vertebrae. Leglocks are allowed in varying
degrees depending on skill level, with the most prominent BJJ tournaments
typically allowing only the straight ankle lock and muscle stretching
submissions such as the "banana split" from white through purple belt, with
the kneebar, toehold, and calf slicer submissions being permitted at brown and
black belt. Heel hooks and knee-reaping are illegal in gi BJJ, since they are
considered to be exceptionally dangerous techiniques, but are allowed by
IBJJF rules in no-gi competitions.[33][46] Most joint locks involving the wrist,
elbow, shoulder or ankle are permitted as there is a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those locks
are usually safe.

Joint locks include armbars, kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, omoplata, marceloplata, banana split (or
electric chair), twister, wrist lock, heel hook, toehold, kneebar, straight ankle lock, and others.[47]
Chokes are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used put
pressure on the carotid arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve
baroreceptors in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done
properly) with victims typically losing consciousness in around 3–5 seconds.
In contrast, an air choke (involving constriction of the windpipe) can take up
to two minutes, depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and
may cause serious damage to the throat.
Chokes include rear-naked choke, triangle, bow and arrow choke, sleeve
choke (or Ezekiel choke), guillotine, cross collar choke (or X choke), baseball
choke, D'Arce, clock choke, Arm triangle choke, north–south choke, crucifix
choke, anaconda choke, Gogoplata, loop choke, and others.
The Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner's uniform (commonly referred to using the
Japanese terms gi or kimono) is similar to a judogi, but often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs on the
pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an
opponent to manipulate, although there is a significant overlap in the standards that allows for a carefully
selected gi to be legal for competition in both styles. Traditionally, to be promoted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the
wearing of the Jiu-Jitsu gi while training is a requirement. Recently with the growing popularity of "no-gi"
Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the practice of giving out belts to no-gi practitioners (e.g., Rolles Gracie awarding Rashad
Evans a black belt) has become more common.
There are certain differences between gi jiu-jitsu and "no-gi" jiu-jitsu. In gi jiu-jitsu one can grip an opponent's
uniform, using it to submit or advance position. There are a number of submissions that are specific to the gi,
such as the "Loop choke", "Collar choke", and others. A specific set of rules to guide no-gi competitions is
issued by the IBJJF, but there may be variation in the set of rules applied in each competition. By IBJJF rules
uniform grips are not permitted in "no-gi" jiu-jitsu.[28]
The Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking
system awards a practitioner
different coloured belts to signify
increasing levels of technical
knowledge and practical skill.
While the system's structure
shares its origins with the judo
ranking system and the origins of
all coloured belts, it now contains
many of its own unique aspects
and themes. Some of these
differences are relatively minor,
such as the division between
Chokes

Grading
youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous
with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional criteria, including as a focus on a competitive
demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general.[48][49]
Traditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and earned route of promotion
holds true.[48][49] Some schools have placed a green belt for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due
to the long periods between advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many
children's programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.
Unlike in some martial arts such as taekwondo and karate, a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu commonly takes
more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally considered expert level. The amount of time it takes
to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous
backgrounds in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through any
intermediate rank, though this has fallen out of favour in recent times.[50] Others have achieved the rank in
relatively short time frames.[51] Outside of exceptions such as these, the average time frame is around 10 years
with a consistent training schedule.[52] However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders Hélio and
Carlos Gracie) has stated that the average of 10–12 years is longer than necessary, suggesting that the ego of
the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to black belt should take 7 years.[53]
Since its inception in Brazil, jiu-jitsu has had different registered federations and tournaments (some
organizations illegitimately calling themselves federations). The first jiu-jitsu federation was the Jiu-Jitsu
Federation of Guanabara, which has remained a regional federation of Rio de Janeiro, while many others were
founded. Among the most prestigious of the many federations are the Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation
(SJJIF), a nonprofit organization with federations and tournaments around the globe with the mission of
making jiu-jitsu an Olympic sport. The International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation, a profit organization that
hosts a number of tournaments[54] and JJGF, founded by Rickson Gracie, which has focus on both BJJ as selfdefense
and as a sport.[55]
While there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by private individuals and
academies, there are two major entities in jiu-jitsu circles. First, is the Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation
(SJJIF), a (nonprofit) organization with international federations and tournaments. Second, is the International
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), a for-profit company that hosts a number of major tournaments
worldwide. These include the Pan American Championship, European Championship, and the Mundials.
California, New York, and Texas are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently. Other
promotions within North America, such as Battleground Grappling Championship, American Grappling
Federation (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and North American Grappling Association
(NAGA) host tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.
Another tournament to spring from the founding Gracie lineage is the Gracie Nationals or Gracie Worlds.
Founded in 2007 by Rose Gracie, daughter of Ultimate Fighting Championship creator and Brazilian jiu-jitsu
grandmaster Rorion Gracie. Gracie Nationals/Worlds followed the guidelines of other major tournaments of
the time, implementing a points systems
In 2012, the Gracie Worlds introduced a new submission-only format, removing certain judging systems that
many interpreted as an outdated scoring system. Rose spoke about this change when she said, "Today's
tournaments aren't what my grandfather [Helio Gracie] envisioned. There's so many rules that it takes away
from the actual art of jiu-jitsu. We don't see many submissions. We see cheating, we see decisions made by a
Federations
Tournaments
referee. We need to stand together against this and support a submission only kind of revolution." Cheating in
jiu-jitsu, Rose said, comes in many forms. "[A competitor] will earn a point, then hold for the entire match so
they can win with that one little advantage they got at the start," Rose said. "That's not jiu-jitsu. That's
cheating."[56]
This discontent with points-based and advantage-style competition has been echoed throughout the jiu-jitsu
community, leading to many prominent submission-only style events. At these events, the winner of a match is
determined only by submission, and these tournaments at times have no time limit, or are timed with a result of
double disqualification if there is no submission victory. This form of tournament have yet to become
widespread, but is gaining in popularity especially amongst MMA competitors. Metamoris, a grappling
competition event run by Rose's brother Ralek Gracie, has helped advocate this tournament form. Another
notable example of a submission-only format is the EBI (Eddie Bravo Invitational), which was the first
televised event of its kind, and is now being featured on UFC Fight Pass. Other submission-only events have
cropped up all over the world including TUFF invitational, Polaris Pro Grappling based in the United
Kingdom, Submission Underground backed by longtime MMA star Chael Sonnen, and the QUINTET
promotion, devised by Japanese MMA legend Kazushi Sakuraba and based around teams of five players each
representing a different gym or background.[57]
At tournaments, especially those hosted by the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), some
athletes engage in a practice called "closing out".[58] This occurs when two athletes, usually friends or
members of the same team, meet in a match but refuse to fight. Tournament organizers can minimize the
chance of close-outs by placing athletes from the same team on opposite sides of the bracket, a practice which
makes the finals the only match in which they could possibly meet (assuming each team has no more than two
competitors in a given bracket). When two athletes close out a match, they agree which one of them will
technically forfeit to the other. As this most often occurs in the final matches of tournaments, this usually
means deciding which of the two will win the gold medal and which will win the silver. Notable examples of
closing out include Marcus "Buchecha" Almeida forfeiting the finals of the Absolute division at the 2018
IBJJF World Championship to his friend Leandro Lo, who had suffered a shoulder injury during a previous
match,[59] and frequent close outs between the brothers Paulo and Joao Miyao, who often compete in the same
weight division.[60] Proponents of close-outs claim it fosters team unity and allows competitors to train as hard
and as freely as they can with their teammates. They say that facing a teammate in a competition would make
them hold back in training. Critics of the practice say it diminishes audience enjoyment of tournaments where
it is allowed,[58] and some tournaments, notably the ADCC, ban it.[61]
Brazilian jiu-jitsu is one of the safest full contact martial arts for practitioners. Its injury rate is around 9.2-38.6
per 1000 athlete exposures.[62][63] This is lower than in mixed martial arts (236-286 per 1000), boxing (210-
420 per 1000), judo (25.3-130.6) and taekwondo (20.5-139.5). It is similar to wrestling, which also uses
grappling instead of striking. The few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian jiu-jitsu usually affect the joints
and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners suffer from are ACL tears in the
knees, rotator cuff tears in the shoulders and spinal disc herniations, most commonly in the neck region. Many
are repairable via surgery that require an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training.
Also many athletes suffer from minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist tendonitis, due to overtraining and the
grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.
Health considerations
Safety
Skin health
Dominick Cruz's cauliflower ears
Besides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts, Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners (along
with Wrestlers, Judoka, and other grapplers ) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary
mat conditions. They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease.[64] Several commonly contracted skin
diseases include ringworm, impetigo, herpes gladiatorum, and staph infection.[65] Proper hygiene practices,
including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after class with soap, disinfecting and
covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning of any gi/rashguard/headgear used before the next class, not
sharing used towels/uniforms, and using a barrier cream greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.
Due to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in jiu-jitsu,
the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell. Without immediate
medical treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the
perichondrium that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently
swollen/deformed (cauliflower ear). Wrestling headgear is sometimes
used for the prevention of this condition. Treatment includes draining
the hematoma or surgery.[66]
The practice of taking performance-enhancing drugs, including
anabolic steroids, is believed to be relatively commonplace among
competitors in jiu-jitsu tournaments and has sparked letters and public
statements by some of jiu-jitsu's top competitors, including Comprido
and Caio Terra.[67] In response, the IBJJF began testing for
performance-enhancing drugs at IBJJF sponsored events, starting with
the 2013 Pan American Championship.[68] However, most other
tournaments tend to lack PED testing.
A spinal lock is a multiple joint lock applied to the spinal column, which is performed by forcing the spine
beyond its normal ranges of motion. This is typically done by bending or twisting the head or upper body into
abnormal positions. Commonly, spinal locks might strain the spinal musculature or result in a mild spinal
sprain, while a forcefully and/or suddenly applied spinal lock may cause severe ligament damage or damage to
the vertebrae, and possibly result in serious spinal cord injury, strokes, or death. Spinal locks and cervical locks
are completely forbidden from gi jiu-jitsu,[28] amateur MMA,[30] multiple forms of no-gi jiu-jitsu,[28] Judo,[31]
and other martial arts.[32] Due to its illegal nature and express purpose to cause serious, irrevocable bodily
injury, paralysis, and death, its use both inside and outside of the gym can constitute aggravated assault.[69][70]
The forceful application of chokes such as the Rear Naked Choke and subsequent cranking of the neck whilst
being choked can potentially lead to arterial dissection, which could lead to stroke.[71] Due care should be
exercised when applying these chokes in sparring situations.
